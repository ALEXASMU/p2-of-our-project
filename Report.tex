When working with section 2 of the project, we were faced with the task of developing the module known as alquerque.py. This module is what allows the user to play the game alquerque in a terminal. This program starts by asking the users what type of game they want to play, and then it proceeds to initiate. After the program initiates, the game begins, if the players are bots, it tells the user, what moves the bot made. If the moves, however, are by a player, the player must insert their own moves. The way these moves are made are by standard grid format. In this format, rows are represented by letters, and columns are represented by numbers.
